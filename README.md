# Market trend analyzer

My Final Building AI course project.


## Summary

Using twitter or other social media data to predict specific markets. Using AI methods and historical data to find patterns in the relationship between social media and financial market moves.


## Background

_Which problems does your idea solve?_
Prediction the probablity of the trend of specific markets.

_How common or frequent is this problem?_
This is a major challenge for market players.

_What is your personal motivation?_
I am intereseted in linguistic and in financial markets. This project needs expertise in both topics. 

_Why is this topic important or interesting?_
Generally future markets are not predictable yet there is lots of data on both sides.


## How is it used?

It can be used by a company or a analysts to predict a specific market.


## Data sources and AI methods

There are two main types of data:
* social media: data is accessable eg via twitter API
* financial market data is accessable is accessable and already used for back testing of strategies


## Challenges

The challenge is to find patterns as there are tons of data. 
There are limits to unsupervised learning, therefore maybe a supervised learning with cleaned linguistic data may be better. 
The other limits are how fast a system can detect importnat trends that are important enough.

## What next?

First I want to do a complete course for learning Python coding.
If someone is interested, please, let's share more insight. A good coder woould be great to team up with!
