# Market trend analyzer

My Final Building AI course project.


## Summary

Using twitter or other social media data to predict specific markets. Using AI methods and historical data to find patterns in the relationship between social media and financial market moves.


## Background

_Which problems does your idea solve?_
Prediction the probablity of the trend of specific markets.

_How common or frequent is this problem?_
This is a major challenge for market players. There are many markets e.g. for oil, crops, different shares etc.

_What is your personal motivation?_
I am intereseted in linguistic and in financial markets. This project needs expertise in both topics.

_Why is this topic important or interesting?_
Generally future markets are not predictable yet there is lots of data on both sides. In my opnion, alongisde of experience there is need for intution, too, in order to choose the right data for the right target market.


## How is it used?

It can be used by a company or a analysts to predict a specific market. First it needs some narrow settings in order to be able to predict a specific trend. Later the system shall find ther right data for the chosen market.


## Data sources and AI methods

There are two main types of data:
* social media: data is accessable eg via twitter API
* financial market data is accessable is accessable and already used for back testing of strategies
Apat from this expertise and intuition is needed on which other data can be useful for the analysis.


## Challenges

The challenge is to find patterns as there are tons of data. 
There are limits to unsupervised learning, therefore maybe a supervised learning with cleaned linguistic data may be better. 
The other limits are how fast a system can detect the right trends that are important enough to make a difference.

## What next?

First I want to do a complete course for learning Python coding.
If someone is interested in the topic, please, let's exchange. 
A good coder woould be great to team up with!
